DD1K{
the limit on the system size will be  settled to be equal to (k-1) hences if a customer would increase to total number in the system to k he will refused to enter.

MM{
discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, an M/M/1 queue represents the queue length in a system having a single server, where arrivals are determined by a Poisson process and job service times have an exponential distribution. The model name is written in Kendall's notation. The model is the most elementary of queueing models.

MM1K{
This model describes a queue with a single server which serves customers in the order in which they arrive. ... 1 Page 2 there is a finite waiting room of size K, we call it an M/M/1/K queu

MMC{
the M/M/c queue (or Erlang–C model) is a multi-server queueing model.
In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals form a single queue and are governed by a Poisson process, there are c servers and job service times are exponentially distributed.
It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server.

MMCK{
a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, the M/M/c queue (or Erlang–C model) is a multi-server queueing model. ... It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server. The model with infinitely many servers is the M/M/∞ queue.
